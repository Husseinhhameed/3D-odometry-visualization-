# 3D Odometry Visualization

Welcome to the 3D Odometry Visualization repository, a dynamic tool developed to render real-time 3D visualizations of odometry data. This project aims to aid in the analysis and interpretation of motion data, enhancing understanding and decision-making in fields like robotics and autonomous vehicle navigation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: View 3D odometry data in real-time, with high-fidelity graphics.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can zoom, rotate, and pan the visualization to examine data from various angles.
- **Data Integration**: Easily import odometry data from various sources and formats for visualization.
- **Customizable Visuals**: Adjust the color, scale, and other visual elements to suit different needs or preferences.

## Built With

- Python
- Additional libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib (for additional data processing and visualization)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
